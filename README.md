# Shodan Search
Very quick library and example of searching shodan for values, exposing a major issue with the current state of many p2p networks which turn on exploitable RPCs by default.  Hoping making this easy to use will bring some light to the situation and help push developers in a more secure design direction istead of making the same mistakes over and over. 


Doesn't yet support login but that would be desirable for more complex search parameters. So maybe in the future.
